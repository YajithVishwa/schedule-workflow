Here's a README file that explains the YAML configuration:

# Scheduled Workflow

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs on a scheduled basis. The workflow is configured to run a script on a self-hosted runner.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow is defined in the `scheduled-workflow.yml` file, and it performs the following actions:

1. **Schedule the Workflow:**
   - The workflow is triggered by a cron schedule. The current configuration runs the workflow daily at midnight (`0 0 * * *`). You can adjust the cron syntax to change the frequency based on your specific requirements.

2. **Jobs:**
   - The workflow defines a job named `build`, which is executed on a self-hosted runner. 

3. **Steps:**
   - **Checkout code:** The workflow checks out the repository's code using the `actions/checkout@v2` action.
   - **Run a script:** A placeholder script is executed, which currently just echoes "Executing Script". You can replace this with any custom script or command you want to run as part of the scheduled task.

## Configuration Details

- **Cron Schedule:**
  - The cron syntax used in the schedule (`0 0 * * *`) represents a time-based job scheduler format that determines when the workflow will be triggered. In this case, the workflow is set to run daily at midnight.
  - [Learn more about cron syntax](https://crontab.guru/) to customize the schedule.

- **Self-hosted Runner:**
  - The workflow is configured to run on a self-hosted runner, which means you need to have a self-hosted runner set up and available for the job to execute successfully. Make sure your runner is properly configured and has the necessary permissions.

- **Script Execution:**
  - The script step currently contains a placeholder command (`echo "Executing Script"`). Replace this with the actual script or commands you want to execute during the scheduled workflow run.

## Getting Started

To use this workflow in your repository:

1. Place the YAML file (`scheduled-workflow.yml`) in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository.
2. Modify the script step to include the commands you want to execute.
3. Ensure that your self-hosted runner is set up and running.
4. Commit and push the changes to your repository.

The workflow will now run automatically based on the configured schedule.

## Customization

You can customize the workflow by:

- Modifying the cron schedule to run at different times or frequencies.
- Adding more steps to the `build` job to perform additional tasks.
- Using different GitHub Actions to extend the functionality of your workflow.
